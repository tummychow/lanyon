# Lanyon
This is a fork of [Lanyon](http://github.com/poole/lanyon), a great [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme by [Mark Otto](http://github.com/mdo). I use Lanyon as a base whenever working with Jekyll, so this repo collects all the changes that I consider "standard".

## Usage
Install the same way as the original Lanyon - clone, then `jekyll serve`. I haven't changed any of the sample content from the original, not even the domain name.

See the [list of commits](http://github.com/tummychow/lanyon/commits?author=tummychow) for details on my changes. Each commit corresponds to one of the modifications I have implemented. If you agree with some of my ideas, but not with others, this should make it easy to pick and choose what you want from my fork. Just be advised that many of my other changes depend on the [first](http://github.com/tummychow/lanyon/commit/4633683), so I recommend you keep that one.

## License
My changes are licensed under the MIT License, as with Lanyon.
